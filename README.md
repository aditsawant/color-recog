# Color-Recognition-Python
Code to recognize the color of any pixel in a provided image.

## Why.
- I recently started learning CSS and was having a hard time with choosing color schemes.
- This code helped me to get the RGB values for any particular color found anywhere online. All I had to do was take a screenshot and use this tool as a colorpicker. 

## How to Run it on your machine.
I have provided an image, to test the code on.
To run the code on your machine, make sure that you have latest version of python installed.
and then,
type this in your terminal CLI: 

```
python my_color_detection.py -i gaytiger.png
```

The image will be displayed in a new window. You can double-click anywhere in the image and see the Color-name of that pixel.

To close the image, hit "ESC" key on your keyboard.
